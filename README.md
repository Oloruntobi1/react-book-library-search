# Online BookShelf

Online Bookshelf as the name implies is a bookshelf bootstrapped with Create-React-App and allows you to cargeorize books between "Want To Read", "Read" and "Currently Reading".

## Installation

After cloning or downloading the zip file of the project, you can run 
```yarn install or npm install
```
in the root of the folder and afterwards
```npm start or yarn start
```
 which automatically opens the project in your browser.

## Usage

There are two pages, the home page and the search page. You can search for topics you are interested in and the books that shw up can willfully be placed on whatever shelf you like which will then be reflected on the home page. There's a search_terms.md file that contains the list of topics you can make searches on.
